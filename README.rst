OpenPIV Spatial Analysis Toolbox
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Warning (Matlab R2014b version is in alpha version)
-------

Spatial Toolbox in the present form does not work on Matlab R2014b due to Matlab's backward incompatibility. Versions 2014a and below are supported.

If you have a newer Matlab (R2014b, R2015a, etc.) please use the not fully tested (on your own risk) version from Alex https://github.com/alexlib/openpiv-spatial-analysis-toolbox/archive/r2014b.zip or clone it from his repository::  

        git clone https://github.com/alexlib/openpiv-spatial-analysis-toolbox.git  
    
        git checkout r2014b



+ Spatial Analysis Toolbox is a collection of Matlab (tm) by Mathworks Inc. subroutines and GUI (also written in Matlab)  that streamlines the post-processing of the PIV (particle image velocimetry) data obtained using OpenPIV or other software (e.g. Insight 3G, 4G from TSI Inc., DaVis from Lavision, VIDPIV, MATPIV, etc.)


+ source code for the project is maintained at
